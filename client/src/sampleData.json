The IT team is supposedly working to restore the online site but doesn't have an ETA for when it will be back up.\n\nOur researchers have still been completing searches via the clerks but there are delays.

If the online site is deprecated, our researchers will be 100% reliant on clerk assistance going forward, which will likely result in delays for the foreseeable future.\n\nUpdate on 8\/2\/2022: The backlog is starting to come down thanks to this strategy.

Also, the number of researchers alShort-termed in the court is limited due to social distancing. In addition, the court is short staffed and doesn't plan to add additional clerks until 2022.\n\nThese barriers have been further complicated by the removal of the DOB from the readily available public access system.
